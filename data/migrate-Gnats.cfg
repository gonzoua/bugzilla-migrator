# This maps field names in your bug-tracker to Bugzilla field names. If a field

# description of each bug migrated. If the right side is an empty string, it

# Some migrators create certain custom fields by default. If you see a

# the migrator and you don't have to worry about it.

# This configuration variable allows you to say that a particular field

# value when it's imported into Bugzilla.

#     bug_status => {
#         # Translate "Handled" into "RESOLVED".
#         "Handled"     => "RESOLVED",

#         # Translate "Serious" into "Highest"
#         "Serious" => "Highest",
#     },
# };
#
# Values are translated case-insensitively, so "foo" will match "Foo", "FOO",
# and "foo".
#
# Note that the field names used are *Bugzilla* field names (from the fielddefs
# table in the database), not the field names from your current bug-tracker.
#
# The special field name "user" will be used to translate any field that
# can contain a user, including reporter, assigned_to, qa_contact, and cc.
# You should use "user" instead of specifying reporter, assigned_to, etc.
# manually.
#
# The special field "bug_status_resolution" can be used to give certain
# statuses in your bug-tracker a resolution in Bugzilla. So, for example,
# you could translate the "fixed" status in your Bugzilla to "RESOLVED"
# in the "bug_status" field, and then put "fixed => 'FIXED'" in the
# "bug_status_resolution" field to translated a "fixed" bug into
# RESOLVED FIXED in Bugzilla.
